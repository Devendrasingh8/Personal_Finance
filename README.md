Standard deviation and Variation: The standard deviation is a measure that expresses how much variance or dispersion there is in a group of numbers. While a high standard deviation suggests that the values are dispersed over a wider range, a low standard deviation suggests that the values tend to be close to the mean (also known as the anticipated value) of the collection. The transaction value for Home Improvement can be seen to vary from $9200 maximum to $6 minimum and had highest standard deviation value.

There was a peak in total spending around 5th and 6th month of 2018 and 2019 year. This was due to large transactions in Home Improvement categories.
